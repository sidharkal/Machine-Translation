Machine Translation

Back in the old days, traditional phrase-based translation systems performed their task by breaking up source sentences into multiple chunks and then translated them phrase-by-phrase. This led to disfluency in the translation outputs and was not quite like how we, humans, translate. We read the entire source sentence, understand its meaning, and then produce a translation. Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
